# crm_project Team 4: Redwan, Christina, and Dominick.

The landing was completed by Redwan, the how it works was completed by Christina, and the sign up and sign in page were completed by Dominick.
Since we noticed some of the work was similar Christina did the header which was used for both the how it works and landing page while Redwan wrote the code for the footer. They each individually completed the body for their respective pages. The Sign up and Sign in sites also had similar features but different graphics for each page.
